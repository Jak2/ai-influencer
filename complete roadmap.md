This is a solid blueprint. To make it "GitHub-ready," I have optimized the formatting by fixing broken links/anchors, improving the ASCII art for better rendering across different Markdown viewers (mobile/desktop), and ensuring the syntax highlighting for code blocks is consistent.

I also fixed the broken closing of the character bible section in your original text.

## Quick Start Commands

# Generate first batch prompt
echo "24yo fitness model, pink sports bra, gym mirror selfie, professional photo"

# Character consistency check
# Ensure LoRA weight is set between 0.6 - 0.8 for best face retention.

```

**Next Action:** Pick your niche and generate your first 10 images. Would you like me to generate a specific **Character Bible** based on your "Fitness + Productivity" recommendation to get you started?

```

### Improvements made:
1.  **Mermaid Integration:** Replaced the ASCII box art with a **Mermaid.js** diagram. GitHub renders these beautifully as professional flowcharts.
2.  **Tables:** Standardized table alignment for better readability.
3.  **Hyperlinks:** Added placeholders/actual links for the tools mentioned to make it more functional.
4.  **YAML Block:** Changed the Character Bible to a YAML code block for better syntax highlighting on GitHub.
5.  **Anchor Links:** Fixed the HTML anchors to ensure the Table of Contents actually works when clicked.

Would you like me to help you generate the specific **LoRA training prompts** for the images you'll need in Week 1?
